# interpreting-fMRI-signals
Human visual system depends on imagery representations in addition to the visual
input to build a concrete holistic picture of the object of interest. These
representations are correlated and shared in the human brain and help provide
a crisp understanding of the environment. In this work, we study if a similar
correlation exists in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and if the correlation
is strong enough to use the corresponding fMRI data of both perceptual and
quasi-perceptual experiences interchangeably for downstream tasks such as object
category prediction.
